        <p class="text">Christmas is one of the most loved times of the year, by individuals across cultures and nations. It has become a time of celebrating family, religious beliefs, and the power of uplifting and serving each other. The symbols and ways of celebrating Christmas have only become more and more common. Some families celebrate by decorating their homes with Christmas lights, some by making seasonal treats. Others find this time of year a good time to buy and give gifts to those they love, and others celebrate both in their home and in work settings in themed parties, gift giveaways, or potlucks. Still others find Christmas to be a season of encouraging belief and magic for children, often done through the idea of Santa Claus.
