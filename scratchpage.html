        <p class="text">Christmas is one of the most loved times of the year, by individuals across cultures and nations. It has become a time of celebrating family, religious beliefs, and the power of uplifting and serving each other. The symbols and ways of celebrating Christmas have only become more and more common. Some families celebrate by decorating their homes with Christmas lights, some by making seasonal treats. Others find this time of year a good time to buy and give gifts to those they love, and others celebrate both in their home and in work settings in themed parties, gift giveaways, or potlucks. Still others find Christmas to be a season of encouraging belief and magic for children, often done through the idea of Santa Claus. However, in our modern, technology-loving society, movies too have become Christmas staples. They are a way for the whole family to get together, to enjoy the same favorites each year and to enjoy them together, regardless of age. It's interesting to note that, oftentimes, favorite Christmas movies as an adult originate from the classics seen as a child because they are so closely tied to the traditions of the season. In reflecting personally on my own childhood and what Christmas classics were reminiscent of the holiday season, I have compiled a list of my top three favorite Christmas movies followed by an interesting interactive look at some of the most common words and phrases in Christmas movies today. May this be a reminder of a faithful holiday tradition and of Christmas classics in your own family.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>White Christmas (1954)
            <ul>
                <li>This movie is a Christmas tradition in my household- between the star-studded cast, including Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, and the beautiful costuming, it's no wonder it's lasted the test of time.</li>
                <li>This movie also makes #1 on the list for its timeless music. Easily recognizable and sung by some of the era's best, the movie's soundtrack only adds to the nostalgic feel.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>The Grinch Who Stole Christmas (2000)
            <ul>
                <li>This movie has been remade from its original Dr. Seuss story several times, but as a modern classic, Jim Carrey's lively adaption of the classic character only added to a full-family favorite Christmas classic.</li>
                <li>This movie makes the top 3 of Christmas favorites primarily for its humor factor, because while finding something that is fun for both parents and kids is tricky, this movie does so seamlessly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
        <li>Home Alone (1990)
            <ul>
                <li>This movie sparked several secondary adaptions, although the original duology is the classic take on a kid being left behind for the holidays and humor for all ages.</li>
                <li>This movie falls at #3 for me because of its sentimentality and humor; everyone wants to be home on Christmas, but the way in which Kevin McCallister realizes that is hilarious for everyone to watch.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
